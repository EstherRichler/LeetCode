# leetcode_solutions
A collections of LeetCode problems that I've solved.

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for each LeetCode problem that I have solved in Python. The notebooks are entitled LC_XXXX where the XXXX is the LeetCode problem number. For each problem I record my solution and the speed and memory usage of the solution. If my solution ranks less than average for speed or memory I try to improve it until it ranks above average, and the notebooks contain all the tries and the speed and memory rankings for each try. Sometimes I also include nice solutions that I found in the discussion boards, especially if there is something in them that was new to me.

The other two files in this repository are csv files named problems_info and problems_topics.

The problems_topics csv file contains the names of topics covered in each problem. These are taken from the Related Topics field on the problem description page, although I will occasionally add some of my own. I use these as keywords so I can easily find and refer back to problems I've solved in the past.

The problems_info csv file contains the following information about each problem and solution:

PROBLEM_NO - The number of the problem on LeetCode

NAME - The name of the problem on LeetCode

LANGUAGE - Python or SQL

DATE_COMPLETED - Date completed

LC_LEVEL - LeetCode difficulty level (easy, medium, hard)

RUNTIME_PERCENTILE - LeetCode calculated percentile for how fast my solution was compared to others (higher percentile value means was faster)

MEMORY_PERCENTILE - LeetCode calculated percentile for how much memory my solution uses compared to others (higher percentile value means I used less memory)

POSTED_TO DISCUSSION - Whether I posted my solution into the LeetCode discussion board for this problem (y/null). I will do this if I came up with a simple or nice solution on my own that ranks well.

NEW_FUNCTIONS - The name of any function or operator that I learned from this problem that I had not known about before
